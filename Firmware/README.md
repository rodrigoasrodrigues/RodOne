# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware

Ths printer uses Marlin 1.1 as Firmware. Marlin is available at github and you should check the repo for an updated version of the firmware.
This is a "backup" of the firmware I am currentyl running on my printer and if you have the exact same hardware the config values should match and id shoud work "out of the box". However you will probably have to tune the values a bit for optimal printing.

check marling at [their repository.](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin)
